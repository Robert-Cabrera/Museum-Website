# [Museum Website](https://robert-cabrera.github.io/Museum-Website/index.html)

This website is a project simply to illustrate my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any profit or scam intent.
It contains various animations and hovers effects that can only be seen from a desktop.

The different resources used were taken from:

W3School  <br />
CSS Tricks <br /> 
Joy of Museums Virtual Tour <br />
Font Awesome <br />
Google fonts <br />
