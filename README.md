#Museum Website

This website is a project simply to illustrate my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any profit or scam intent.
It contains various animations and hovers effects that can only be seen from a desktop.

The different resources used were taken from:

W3School
CSS Tricks
Joy of Museums Virtual Tour
Font Awesome
Google fonts
